# Combine vs Async Algorithms: What are the differences? ðŸ¤¨

## Content

This repository contains the code sample I've used during July 14th's livestream ðŸ‘‰ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5oKJ99tRZbk

The repo is organized in two branches:

* [before](https://github.com/vincent-pradeilles/live-async-algorithms/tree/before) contains the code of a simple app, where the asynchronous code uses Combine
* [after](https://github.com/vincent-pradeilles/live-async-algorithms/tree/after) contains the code of the same app, where the asynchronous code now uses Async Algorithms

(Please note the code was built using Xcode 14 beta 3)
